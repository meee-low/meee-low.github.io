<h2>Top 5 Simple Concepts I Would Teach Every Programmer</h2>

<h3>
  Different magnitudes of speed for different information storages (cpu, cache,
  ram, disk, web)
</h3>
<h3>Bandwidth vs latency/ping</h3>
<h3>Allocating and cleaning (garbage collection) memory is slow</h3>
<h3>Fuzzy testing</h3>
<h3>Writing testable code (pure functions)</h3>
<h3>Version Control (git, git bisect)</h3>
<h3>Vim Motions</h3>
<h3>Terminal</h3>
<h3>Can't trust user input.</h3>
<h3>Floating point numbers are weird</h3>
0.1 + 0.2 !== 0.3 ({0.1 + 0.2}) Different scales (scientific notation) Compare
only using an epsilon, never directly.
<h3>
  Different math operations have different performance. (division and mod vs
  multiplication)
</h3>
<h3>Language spec vs implementation (compiler, runtime)</h3>
<h3>Databases (joins, normalization etc)</h3>
